      "name": "Metadata Scraping / Automated Song Backup",
      "description": "I built a two-part Python automation pipeline to extract song titles and artist names from a web-based playlist. I used Selenium to scrape the data and save it to a structured text file. Then, I wrote a second script that automatically searched each track on YouTube, captured the top video URL, and compiled the links into a list for batch downloading. I used this list with yt-dlp to efficiently download the entire playlist, streamlining the process of creating offline music libraries.",

      "name": "Automated Payment Verification",
      "description": "I created a custom Python script to automate the verification of product payments by comparing two CSV filesâ€”one containing customer order data and the other listing Venmo transaction history. This project significantly streamlined what was previously a manual and error-prone task by automatically cross-referencing customer names, amounts, and timestamps to confirm completed payments. Built and tested in VS Code, the script reduced data entry and verification time by over 90%, greatly improving both speed and accuracy in processing customer transactions.",
